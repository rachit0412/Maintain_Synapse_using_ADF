t sounds like you're referring to a GitHub repository that includes Azure Data Factory (ADF) pipelines for managing and scaling dedicated SQL pools in Azure Synapse Analytics. These pipelines typically include activities to:

Retrieve information about SQL pools.
Filter relevant SQL pools.
Check and control the state of SQL pools (pause/resume).
Dynamically scale the performance levels of SQL pools as needed.
One example of such a repository is the Scale-Dedicated-SQL-Pool-Dynamically template on GitHub1. This template provides a detailed guide on how to scale up and down a dedicated SQL pool in Azure Synapse Analytics, including the necessary activities and parameters.
